             It is always my dream to be a seaman someday. My reasons are not that special, it is just that I find it so cool wearing a uniform with that job and of course it offers high salary. I see myself working, has a stable job and I can finally help my family financially because it is also my dream to help them. I will study harder so that I can pay my mother's sacrifices in working abroa d and also my grandmother's sacrifices for looking after me.
