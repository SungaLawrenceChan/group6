# Act07 - Presentation Layer (Individual)
In this activity, you will modify your website and link a presentation layer using CSS. 

Use the appropriate elements/rules for it to look presenatable and interesting. Webpage sections should be observed properly.
Images embedded on your website should be placed inside the "images" folder, style.css should be inside the "css" folder and files should be renamed to an easy and reconizable filename beforehand.

Publish your websites before passing your index cards.

The readme.md should also show and describe outputs. 

Be mindful of the autograding feature of this activity. I included a script to auto check the validity of the elements based on the W3C standards we discussed before. You will get 10 points on written grade for each of the page you created when you get this right.
